      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Cooking can seem intimidating for beginners or even for the intermediate-level chef. The Unseasoned Chef is a recipe and food-based app to provide a central location for newcomers and novices alike. With a multitude of educational resources
        to get users comfortable around the kitchen, they’ll be able to move onto bigger and more complex recipes in the future and potentially move away from recipes altogether.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>To create an application that provided a unique, educational experience, I had to understand what products were already on the market. This preparation required a competitor analysis to determine some general strengths and weaknesses from
          the pre-existing products as well as what these applications use as marketing advantages to target key audiences.
          <br>
          <br>
          Keeping these analyses in mind, I then organized and held interviews with people in our target audience demographic, using people of various ages, diets, stages of life, and cookind levels to discern common paint points and intriguiging
          potential key features.
        </p>
        <p class="tuc-data"><strong>60%</strong> of users had <strong>dietary restrictions</strong> that informed their nutrition intake and cooking goals
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>90%</strong> of users started cooking to control what they were putting in their bodies.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>80%</strong> of users claim their journey to comfort in the kitchen <strong>began when they went college.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Based on these findings, I created three user personas to inform my preliminary sketches and wireframes, focusing on key features like instructional videos and a diet filter option. </p>

      <h3>Sketches</h3>
      <p>After some speed-sketching exercises to explore all layout ideas, I landed on these loosely drawn designs as a jumping off point. With these sketches, I conducted usability testing to ensure a cohesive and efficient user flow. </p>

      <h3>User Flow</h3>
      <img class="project-img flow" src="img/tuc/@1x/tuc-user-diagram.png" alt="User Flow Diagram">
      <p>The results of these tests led to important features and design additions:</p>
      <ul class="tuc-data">
        <li>Food preparation filter/search by cooking style</li>
        <li>More access to search bar on the main page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After perfecting the user flows and designs in the usability testing, I began designing the low-, mid-, and high-fidelity wireframes. </p>

        <h3>Preference Test</h3>
        <p>Before I finalized the UI for The Unseasoned Chef, I designed two possible layouts to present a recipe’s nutrition values. In order to decide which screen worked best, I conduct a preference test for users to provide input.</p>
        <img class="project-img tuc pref-test" src="img/tuc/@1x/tuc-pref-test.png" alt="TUC Preference Testing">
        <h3>Final UI</h3>
        <img class="project-img tuc" src="img/tuc/@1x/tuc-final.png" alt="TUC Final User Interfaces">
        <p>After creating the high-fidelity wireframes, I organized a round of critique from peers in order to gain valuable feedback and assure that all breakpoints were consistent in design. This final round of critique was important to creating a
          functional, responsive web application.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <div class="reflection">
          <h5>What went well?</h5>
          <p>I am very satisfied with the end product and the cohesive layouts for each responsive breakpoint. The color palette and typography choices help the application stand out from the already saturated market. I enjoyed conducting the user
            testing and creating prototypes to ensure an efficient and usable user flow.</p>
          <h5>What didn't go well?</h5>
          <p>As this project began with a mobile-first approach, the larger breakpoints feel a bit heavier and less-refined.</p>
          <h5>What could be improved?</h5>
          <p>The layout for the larger breakpoints can be improved by workshopping alternative options and conducting user testing to determind interface pain points and frustrations. The color palette, chosen for the calming and friendly blues, I
            think shades of green and pastel orange could also be beneficial to this design for a warm and earthly tone.</p>
          <h5>Moving Forward</h5>
          <p>Moving forward, I plan to incorporate the competitor/SWOT analyses into my future projects to better understand each specific market. I think that each responsive breakpoint requires user testing to help determine layout issues.</p>
